<p>I am going to be looking back at my March Madness picks from a few weeks ago and see where I went wrong in some of my predictions from my XGBoost model. I finished 14th out of 17 people in our classes ESPN NCAA Tournemnent challenge. I was not last but I was far from the top. My XGBoost model bracket was only better than about 20 percent of the other brackets made on ESPN this year. This means that it was not good. My model picked Michigan to win and had the runner up as Colgate. So clearly it was not a good model in terms of what actually ended up happening. I did not have a single final 4 team correct either as Tennesse and Iowa did not even come close. There were people in the class with brackets from their coding models that had them in the top 99.7% of all brackets. They both predicted Baylor to win as well. I was far from their level of predicting power.</p>
<p>From the first round these were the games I got wrong: Virginia over Ohio, St.Â Bonaventure over LSU, UCLA over BYU, Texas over Abilene Christian, UConn over Maryland, Purdue over North Texas, Colgate over Arkansas, Virginia Tech over Florida, Ohio state over Oral Roberts, Tennessee over Oregon state, San Diego state over Syracuse and Clemson over Rutgers.</p>
<p>There is definitely a lot of unpredictable stuff. But when I saw that my model had Colgate almost winning the whole thing I should have made some changes. There were some teams my model had going far that had no actual business going that far. My model had Iowa going to the final 4 over Gonzaga which was laughable because Iowa got ran by Oregon in round two. My model had Iowa in the final 4.
Tennessee did not even win a game and my model had them final four bound as well. So with that being said i think I over fit my model and should have simplified. The people who went with the most simple models in my class did the best.</p>
<p>This experience was very fun and satisfying. I may wanna make the time to do it again next year when the tournement comes around. It was a nice experience to fill out a bracket based upon machine code and also watch it predict each series of games. It was one of the more enjoyable learning experiences I have had and maybe the best with coding. I could have done better if I had a simpler XGBoost model.</p>
